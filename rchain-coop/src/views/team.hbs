    <p>The RChain Cooperative was formed in January 2017 to steward the development and progression of the RChain platform. The cooperative provides the foundational support necessary for RChain to grow into, and remain, a publicly owned and operated information utility. RChain Co-op members invigorate the ecosystem with constant experimentation of governance models, empowering individual agency within a collective.</p>

                    Evan Jensen is a lawyer and a technologist, also with an LLM in Innovation and Technology from Seattle University School of Law, and has been with RChain since the formation of the Cooperative. He has always been an enthusiast of video games and hopes blockchain technology will enable the creation of the ultimate global online arcade, in the classical style where users pay perhaps 25 cents to play a game of their choice once, forever replacing the "freemium" garbage that has become ubiquitious with a direct, independent distribution and payment system that is clear, simple, and fair.
