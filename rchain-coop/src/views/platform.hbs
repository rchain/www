            <h2>CURRENT STATE</h2>
            <p>Today's blockchains have fallen short. Current systems are constrained by the single chain problem. Sequential computing inevitably limits scalability and speed, while increasing transaction costs. Massive energy and computational requirements are major obstacles to mass adoption of decentralized systems.</p>

        <div class="textWrapper">
            <h2>RCHAIN</h2>
            <p>RChain is a complete blockchain platform for distributed applications. Intelligent, concurrent execution throughout the network unlocks blockchain's potential for transactions of every type and scale. Designed for maximum efficiency at minimal computational and environmental cost, RChain provides the foundation and utility for global coordination. Innovations in consensus and concurrent processing increase transaction velocity, security, scalability, and sustainability. Unlike other chains, RChain's concurrent computing capabilities exist natively in the architecture.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A truly decentralized system with transparent participatory incentives.</li>
                <li>Stake-based systems eliminate computing resource waste.</li>

        <h2>Rholang</h2>
        <p>At the center of the RChain platform is Rholang, a breakthrough smart contract programming language based on Rho-Calculus innovation. Lightweight and expressive by design, Rholang is executed by RNodes with fine-grained concurrency. Rholang gives developers a straightforward, safe, and fast tool for blockchain transactions.</p>

        <h2>Reflective Higher Order Computing</h2>
        <p>Reflective Higher Order Calculus (Rho Calculus) is the breakthrough computing model that powers RChain. Rho powers RChainâ€™s unmatched efficiency at scale and makes it possible for developers to build safer dApps, faster.</p>

            <p>Namespaces, virtual groups of RNodes within the RChain network, can be customized by developers for specific parameters.</p>
            <p>Namespaces act as virtual <i>channels</i> on the network, independently and concurrently processing transactions.</p>
            <p>Next-generation sharding divides the network into optimized pieces, eliminating the race conditions found in other chains.</p>
            <p>Developers are empowered to determine how contracts will be executed and optimzed for application-specific requirements.</p>
